The Creed
We believe in one God: God the Father, the Pantocrator, who created heaven and earth, and all things seen and unseen.
We believe in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all ages; Light out of Light, true God of true God, begotten not created; of one essence with the Father, by whom all things were made; who for us men and for our salvation came down from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and of the Virgin Mary, and became Man. And He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, suffered and was buried. And, on the third day He rose from the dead, according to the scriptures; He ascended into the heavens and sat down at the right hand of His Father, and He is coming in His glory to judge the living and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.
Yes, we believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Life-Giver, who proceeds from the Father, who, with the Father and the Son, is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets, and in one holy, catholic and apostolic Church. We confess one baptism for the remission of sins. We look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the coming age. Amen.
