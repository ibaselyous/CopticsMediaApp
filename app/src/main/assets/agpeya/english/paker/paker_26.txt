THE TRISAGION
Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, who was born of the Virgin, have mercy on us.
Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, who was crucified for us, have mercy on us.
Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, who rose from the dead and ascended into the Heavens, have mercy on us. 
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now, and always, and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
O Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord remit our sins. O Lord, pardon our iniquities. O Lord, forgive us our trespasses.
O Lord, visit the sick of Your people, heal them for the sake of Your holy name. Our fathers and brethren who have slept, O Lord, repose their souls.
O Lord, who are without sin, have mercy upon us. O sinless One, help us and accept our prayers to You. For glory, dominion, 
and triple holiness are due to You. Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy. Lord bless us. Amen.
