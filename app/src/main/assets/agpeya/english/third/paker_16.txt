O Theotokos, Mother of God
O Theotokos, Mother of God, you are the true vine who carries Christ, the Fruit of life, we ask you, O full of grace, together with the apostles, to intercede for the sake of our salvation. Blessed be the Lord our God whom we praise every day; He prepares our 
way for He is the God of our salvation. (Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
