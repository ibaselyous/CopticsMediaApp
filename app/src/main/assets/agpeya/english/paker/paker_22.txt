O true Light 

O true Light that gives light to every man who comes into the world, You have come to the world because of Your love for mankind, and all creation rejoiced at Your coming. You saved our father, Adam, from the deception of the serpent, You delivered our mother, Eve, from the pangs of death, and You gave us the Spirit of adoption. Let us therefore praise You and bless You, saying (Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit)
