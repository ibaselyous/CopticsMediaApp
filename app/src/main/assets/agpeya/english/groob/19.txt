O righteous Lord
O righteous Lord, who was born of the Virgin and endured crucifixion for our sake. You conquered death through Your death and manifested resurrection through Your resurrection. Lord, do not turn Your face away from those whom you have created with Your own hands, but manifest Your love toward mankind, O Good One. Accept the intercession of Your Mother on our behalf. O Saviour save us, a humble people. Do not forsake us nor deliver us eternally into the hands of our enemies. Do not revoke Your covenant nor take away Your mercy from us, for the sake of Abraham Your beloved, Isaac Your servant, and Israel Your saint. 
(Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
