The Gloria
Let us praise with the angels, saying, "Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, and goodwill toward men.” We praise You, we bless You, we serve You, we worship You, we confess to You, we glorify You, we give thanks to You for Your great glory, O Lord, heavenly King, God the Father, the Pantocrator: O Lord, the Only-Begotten Son, Jesus Christ; and the Holy Spirit. O Lord God, Lamb of God, Son of the Father, who takes away the sin of the world, receive our prayer. You who sit at the right hand of the Father, have mercy on us. For You only are Holy; You only are Lord, O Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit; glory to God the Father amen. Every day will I bless You, and I will praise Your name forever; yes, forever and ever. Amen. Through the night watches my soul awakes early unto You, O my God, for Your precepts are the light upon the earth. I continually pursue Your ways for You have become a help unto me. My voice shall You hear in the morning. Early will I stand before You, and You shall see me.
