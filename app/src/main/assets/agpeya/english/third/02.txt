The Prayer of Thanksgiving
Let us give thanks to the beneficent and merciful God, the Father of our Lord, God and Saviour, Jesus Christ, for He has covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us to Him, had compassion on us, supported us, and brought us to this hour.
Let us also ask Him, the Lord our God, the Pantocrator, to guard us in all peace this holy day and all the days of our life.
O Master, Lord, God the Pantocrator, the Father of our Lord, God, and Saviour, Jesus Christ, we thank You for every condition, concerning every condition, and in every condition. For You have covered us, helped us, guarded us, accepted us to You, had compassion on us, supported us, and brought us to this hour. Therefore, we ask and entreat Your goodness, O Philanthropic One. Grant us to complete this holy day, and all the days of our life, in all peace in Your fear. All envy, all temptation, all the work of Satan, the counsel of wicked men and the rising up of enemies, hidden and manifest, take
them away from us and from Your people and from this holy place that is Yours.
But those things which are good and profitable do provide for us, for it is You who have given us the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy.
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one, by the grace, compassion and philanthropy, of Your Only-Begotten Son, our Lord, God and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Through whom the glory, the honour, the dominion, and the adoration are due unto You, with Him, and the Holy Spirit, the Life-Giver, who is of one essence with You, now and at all times, and unto the ages of all ages. Amen.
