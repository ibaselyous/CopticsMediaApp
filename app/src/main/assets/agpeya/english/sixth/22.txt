We worship Your incorruptible person
We worship Your incorruptible person, O good Lord, asking for the forgiveness of our sins, O Christ our God; for of Your own will You were pleased to be lifted up on the cross to deliver those whom You created from the bondage of the enemy. We cry out unto You and give thanks to You, O Saviour, for You have filled everyone with joy when You came to save the world. O Lord glory be to You. 
(Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
