O Lord, who accepted the confession 
O Lord, who accepted the confession of the thief on the cross, accept us also unto You, O Good One, even though we indeed justly deserve the condemnation of death as the due reward of our sins. We acknowledge and confess our sins with the thief, proclaiming and testifying to Your divinity, saying: "Remember us O Lord, when You come into Your kingdom!"
(Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
