When the thief saw the Prince of Life

When the thief saw the Prince of Life, hanging on the cross, he said: "Had not the One, crucified with us, been God incarnate, the sun would not have hidden its rays, nor would the earth have quaked and trembled in fear!... But, O Almighty One, who endures everything, remember me, O Lord, when You come into Your kingdom!" (Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit)
