Since we have no favour, excuse
Since we have no favour, excuse, nor justification, because of our many sins, O Theotokos, the Mother of God, we plead through you to Him who was born of you, for your intercession is abundant, powerful, and acceptable to our Saviour. O pure Mother, do not exclude us, sinners, from your intercession with Him who was born of you; for He is merciful and able to save us, because He suffered for our sake in order to deliver us. O Lord, let Your compassion reach us quickly, for we sincerely humbled ourselves. Help us, O God our Saviour, for the sake of Your glorious name. O Lord, deliver us and forgive us our sins, for the sake of Your holy name. 
(Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
