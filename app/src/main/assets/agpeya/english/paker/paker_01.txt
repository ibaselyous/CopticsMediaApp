O come, let us worship, let us ask Christ our God.
O come, let us worship, let us entreat Christ our King.
O come, let us worship, let us implore Christ our Saviour.
Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Word of God, through the intercession of St. Mary and all Your saints, guard us and bring us to a good start. Be merciful to us, as this is Your will forever.
The night has passed. We thank You, Lord, and ask You to keep us, this day, away from sin and deliver us. Amen.

THE PAULINE FROM ST. PAUL'S EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS (4:1-5)
I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you to have a walk worthy of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism.
FROM OUR ORTHODOX FAITH
One is God, the Father of all.
One is his Son, Jesus Christ, the Word, who came in the flesh, died and rose from the dead on the third day, and raised us together, in Him.
One is the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, who proceeds from the Father; He sanctifies all creation and teaches us to worship the Holy Trinity, one Triune who is one in essence and one in nature. We praise Him and bless Him forever. Amen.

The Morning Prayer of this blessed day is offered to Christ my King and God, beseeching Him to forgive my sins.
From the psalms of David the prophet and king. May his blessings be with us all, Amen.
