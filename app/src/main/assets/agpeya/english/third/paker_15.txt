O Lord, who sent Your Holy Spirit 
O Lord, who sent Your Holy Spirit upon Your Holy disciples and honourable apostles at the third hour, do not take Him away from us, O Good One; but we ask You our Lord Jesus Christ, the Logos, Son of God, to renew Him within us: the Spirit of uprightness and life-giving, the Spirit of prophecy and chastity, the Spirit of holiness, justice and authority. Our almighty God, the light of our souls illuminating every person who comes into this world, have mercy upon us.
