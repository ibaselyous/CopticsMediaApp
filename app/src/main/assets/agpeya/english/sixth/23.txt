You are full of grace O Theotokos
You are full of grace O Theotokos, the Mother of God, the holy virgin. We magnify you for through the cross of your Son, Hades was cast down, and Death was abolished! Assuredly, we were dead before, but now we are raised and made worthy to inherit eternal life and to attain the joy of Paradise. Therefore, we thankfully glorify the immortal Christ our God.
