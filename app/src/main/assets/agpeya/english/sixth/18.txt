O Lord who on the sixth day 
O Lord who on the sixth day and at the sixth hour, were nailed to the cross on account of the sin that our father Adam dared to commit in Paradise; wipe out the handwriting of our sins, O Christ our God and save us. I cried out unto God and the Lord heard me. O Lord, answer my prayer and do not dismiss my supplication. Attend to me and hear me in the evening, in the morning, and at mid-day. 
I will plead with the Lord and He will hear my voice and peacefully save my soul.
(Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit)
