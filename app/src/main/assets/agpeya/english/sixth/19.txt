O Jesus Christ, our God
O Jesus Christ, our God, who was nailed to the cross at the sixth hour, You have put away sin by Your cross; and through Your death You revived man who was dead by sin, whom You had created with Your own hands. O Lord, put to death our sinful passions by Your healing and life-giving Passion. And through the nails of Your crucifixion, rescue our minds from all foolishness of earthly deeds and desires, to the remembrance of Your heavenly commandments, according to Your great compassion!
(Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
