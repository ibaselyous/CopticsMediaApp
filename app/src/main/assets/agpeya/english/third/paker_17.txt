O Heavenly King, the Comforter

O Heavenly King, the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, who is present everywhere and fills all; You are the treasure of goodness and the Life-Giver, graciously come and abide in us, O Good One, purify us of all iniquities and save our souls. (Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit)
