O Theotokos, the mother of God

O Theotokos, the mother of God, the second heaven, you are the honoured mother of the Light who is blessed and praised from sunrise to sunset by all generations, for you are the bright and unchanging blossom, and the ever-virgin mother; for the Father chose you, and the Holy Spirit overshadowed you, and the Son humbled Himself to take flesh from you and to become man. Therefore, we implore you to intercede with Him to save the world that He created and to deliver it from tribulation. Let us praise Him with a new hymn, and bless Him, now and at all times and forevermore. Amen.
