O Christ, our Lord

O Christ, our Lord, the true Light, as daylight shines upon us, let the bright senses and the luminous thoughts shine within us, and do not let the darkness of sinful passions overtake us, so that we may praise You with David, saying: My eyes are awake even before dawn, that I may meditate on Your word. Hear our voices according to Your great mercy and revive us, O Lord, according to Your loving kindness! 

(Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
