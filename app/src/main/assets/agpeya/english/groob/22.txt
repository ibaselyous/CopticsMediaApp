When the Mother saw the Lamb 

When the Mother saw the Lamb and the Shepherd, the Saviour of the world, hanging on the cross, she said as she wept: "As for the world: let it rejoice in receiving Salvation, but as for me: my inward parts are burning with pain within me, when I behold Your crucifixion which You are patiently enduring, for the sake of all, O my son and my God!"
