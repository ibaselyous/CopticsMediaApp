Absolution (Terce)
O compassionate God, Lord of all comfort, who consoled us at all times with Your Holy Spirit; we thank You for raising us to prayer at this holy hour in which You abundantly poured Your Holy Spirit like tongues of fire upon Your holy disciples and blessed apostles.
We pray and entreat Your good ness, O lover of mankind, to accept our prayers, forgive our sins and grant us the grace of Your Holy Spirit. Purify our bodies and spirits of all iniquities and lead us into a spiritual life so that we may walk according to the Spirit and do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. Make us worthy to serve You with purity and righteousness, all the days of our lives; for due unto You is glory, honour and power, with Your good Father and the Holy Spirit, now and at all times and unto the end of all ages! Amen.

The Concluding Prayer of Every Hour
Have mercy upon us O God, have mercy upon us, who, at all times and at every hour, is worshipped and glorified in heaven and on earth. O Christ, our good Lord, who is longsuffering, abundant in mercy and full of compassion, who loves the righteous and shows mercy to all sinners, of whom I am chief; who does not wish the death of the sinner but rather to repent and to live; who calls all men to salvation and to the promised forthcoming rewards. O Lord, accept our prayers at this hour and at every hour. Facilitate our lives, and guide us to act according to Your commandments. Sanctify our souls, cleanse our bodies, set aright our thoughts, purify our intentions, heal our sickness, forgive us our sins and deliver us from every evil grief and anguish of heart. Surround us by Your holy angels that we may be
guided and guarded by them to attain the unity of the faith and the knowledge of Your imperceptible and infinite glory, for You are blessed forever. Amen
