O Lord, who tasted death 
O Lord, who tasted death in the flesh at the ninth hour for our sake, us sinners, put to death our carnal desires O Christ our God and deliver us. Let my supplication draw close to You, O Lord; according to Your word give me understanding. Let my prayer come before You and revive me according to Your word. 
(Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit)
