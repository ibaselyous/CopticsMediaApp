(Lord have mercy) - 41 times
Holy Holy Holy
Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of Your glory and honour. O God, the Father almighty, have mercy upon us. O Holy Trinity have mercy upon us. O Lord, God of hosts, be with us, for we have no helper in our tribulations and adversities but You. O God, absolve, remit, and forgive us our sins which we did willfully and unwillfully, those which we committed knowingly and unknowingly, the concealed ones and the manifest ones. O Lord, forgive us for the sake of Your holy name which is called upon us, according to Your mercy and not according to our sins.
