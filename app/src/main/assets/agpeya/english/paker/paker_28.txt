Intercession of the Most Holy Mother of God
Hail to you. We ask you, O Saint full of glory, the ever-virgin, Theotokos, mother of Christ, offer our prayers unto your beloved Son, that He may forgive us our sins. Hail to the holy Virgin, who has brought forth unto us the true Light, Christ our God. Ask the Lord on our behalf, that He may have mercy on us and forgive us our sins.
O virgin Mary, the holy Theotokos, the faithful advocate of all mankind, intercede on our behalf before Christ, whom you have brought forth, that He may forgive us our sins.
Hail to you, O virgin, the true queen. Hail to the pride of our race, who has born to us Emmanuel.
We ask you, remember us, O our faithful advocate before our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may forgive us our sins.
