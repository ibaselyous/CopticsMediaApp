O Lord, who commended Your spirit 
O Lord, who commended Your spirit into the hands of the Father when You were crucified at the ninth hour; and led the thief who was crucified with You into Paradise, do not neglect me, O Good One, nor reject me, I who am lost. Rather, sanctify my soul, enlighten my understanding and allow me to partake of the grace of Your life-giving sacraments; so that when I taste Your goodness I may offer You praise without lukewarmness, longing for Your glory above all things O Christ our God, save us. (Now and forever and unto the ages of all ages, Amen)
