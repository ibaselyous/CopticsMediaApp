The Lord reigns
The Lord reigns; let the peoples tremble! He dwells between the cherubim; let the earth be moved! The Lord is great in Zion, and He is high above all the peoples. Let them praise Your great and awesome name; He is holy. The King's strength also loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His footstool; for He is holy. Moses and Aaron were among His priests, and Samuel was among those who called upon His name; they called upon the Lord, and He answered them. He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; they kept His testimonies and the ordinance that He gave them. You answered them, O Lord our God; You were to them God-who-forgives, though You took vengeance on their deeds. Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at His holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy. Alleluia.
